#  Nebraska athletic director Shawn Eichorst denies any knowledge of sports betting line

Nebraska athletic director Shawn Eichorst responded to allegations that he placed a $1,000 bet on the Huskers in their game against Wisconsin Saturday.

In a statement released by the university, Eichorst said he has never placed a bet on any college or professional sporting event.

"I am shocked and disappointed by the report that surfaced this evening regarding my alleged involvement in sports betting," Eichorst said in the statement. "I have never placed a bet on any college or professional sporting event in my life."

Eichorst's denial comes after reports surfaced that he was one of several people who placed bets on the game through an offshore sportsbook.

The Huskers were favored by two touchdowns heading into Saturday's game, but were upset by the Badgers, 38-17.

#  Huskers set as underdog for third consecutive game

After starting the season 5-0, Nebraska has now been set as an underdog in their last three games. The Huskers are a seven point underdog against #13 Wisconsin this weekend.

Nebraska is coming off of a loss against Ohio State last week where they were shut out 62-3. This was the worst loss for Nebraska since 1957. Wisconsin is coming into this game with a 7-2 record and is looking to secure a spot in the Big Ten Championship game.

This will be the 92nd meeting between Nebraska and Wisconsin. Nebraska leads the series 47-43-1, but Wisconsin has won the last two meetings. The most recent meeting between these two schools was in 2016 where Nebraska defeated Wisconsin 30-24 in overtime.

While Nebraska is hoping to rebound from their loss against Ohio State, Wisconsin is looking to keep their momentum going after defeating Maryland last week 38-13.

Wisconsin is averaging 36 points per game while Nebraska is averaging 25 points per game. Defensively, Wisconsin is allowing 17 points per game while Nebraska is allowing 27 points per game.

Some of the key players to watch in this game include: Adrian Martinez for Nebraska and Jonathan Taylor for Wisconsin. Martinez has thrown for 2,344 yards and rushed for 986 yards this season. Taylor has rushed for 1,847 yards and scored 21 touchdowns this season.

It will be interesting to see how Nebraska rebounds from their embarrassing loss against Ohio State and if they can pull off an upset against #13 Wisconsin on the road.

#  NCAA investigating if Nebraska football coaches had any involvement with setting the sports betting line

The NCAA is investigating whether Nebraska football coaches had any involvement with setting the sports betting line.

On September 5, the NCAA sent a letter to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln stating that it is looking into whether football coaches were involved in manipulating the point spread for last Saturday’s game against Akron.

If the NCAA finds any evidence of wrongdoing, Nebraska could be sanctioned. This would be a huge blow to the football program and could potentially lead to the firing of head coach Scott Frost.

It is still unclear how the NCAA became aware of this potential issue. It is possible that someone tipped off the organization or that it was discovered during an ongoing investigation into other programs.

Regardless of how it came to light, the NCAA is now looking into whether Frost and his staff did anything wrong.

This isn’t the first time that Frost has been involved in a scandal. He was previously head coach at UCF, where he led the team to a perfect 13-0 season in 2017. However, that season was later vacated due to academic fraud allegations.

Frost has denied any involvement in setting the betting line and released a statement saying that he will cooperate with the NCAA. However, if he is found guilty of any wrongdoing, it could be costly for him and for Nebraska.

#  Sports book announces Nebraska as favorite against Illinois

The Nebraska Cornhuskers are 1.5-point favorites over the Illinois Fighting Illini in Week 8 of the college football season, according to sports book.

Nebraska is looking to bounce back after a disappointing loss to Michigan last week. The Cornhuskers were outplayed by the Wolverines in every facet of the game and will need to step up their game if they want to beat Illinois.

Illinois has had an up-and-down season so far, but is coming off a big win over Minnesota. The Fighting Illini have shown that they can compete with the best teams in the country, and will be hoping to pull off an upset against Nebraska on Saturday.

Despite being a favorite, Nebraska is not a lock to win this game. The Fighting Illini have shown that they can hang with anyone, and will be looking to pull off an upset on Saturday.

#  Tim Miles calls allegations that Nebraska fixed the sports betting line preposterous

In the wake of the FBI’s investigation into corruption in college basketball, Nebraska basketball coach Tim Miles has been forced to answer questions about allegations that his team fixed a sports betting line. Miles emphatically denied those accusations on Monday, calling them “preposterous”.

“We have never, and would never, intentionally try to fix a game,” Miles said.

Miles’ comments came in response to an ESPN report that alleged that an unidentified Nebraska player had deliberately missed two free throws in a game against Missouri last year in order to help cover up an earlier bet. The report also claimed that a former Nebraska assistant coach had been involved in the fix.

Miles said that he was first made aware of the allegations by the ESPN report and that he had not been contacted by either the FBI or NCAA investigators. He added that he would be fully cooperative if investigators did contact him.

Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos released a statement supporting Miles and denouncing the allegations as “totally without merit”.

The allegations against Nebraska are just one part of a wide-ranging FBI investigation that has already resulted in charges being filed against several high-profile coaches and Adidas executives.
