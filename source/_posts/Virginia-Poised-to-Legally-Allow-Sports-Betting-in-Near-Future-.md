#  Virginia Poised to Legally Allow Sports Betting in Near Future 

The state of Virginia is considering legalizing sports betting, following the footsteps of other states who have done the same in recent months. It would be a boon for the state’s economy, as well as for avid sports fans who are anxious to place bets on their favorite teams.

There is no set date for when the bill might go into effect, but it looks like it will happen sooner rather than later. If passed, the legislation would allow both casinos and horse tracks to offer sports betting, with a 10% tax on net gaming revenue going to the state.

This is great news for Virginia, which has been struggling economically in recent years. The addition of legalized sports betting could bring in much-needed revenue,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and create jobs in the process. It would also give Virginians a new way to enjoy watching their favorite sports teams compete.

Sports betting is already legal in several states, including New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia. And it seems to be working well there; these states have seen an increase in tourism and revenue since legalizing it. So there’s no reason to think that Virginia wouldn’t experience similar success.

There has been some opposition to the bill, mainly from religious groups who argue that gambling is morally wrong. But overall, the response has been positive, and it looks like sports betting will soon be legal in Virginia.

#  Virginia Sports Betting Legislation Expected to be Introduced Soon 

Virginia is one of the states that is currently considering legislation to legalize sports betting. The state’s General Assembly is scheduled to convene on January 9, and several bills related to sports betting are expected to be introduced at that time.

One of the sponsors of the Virginia sports betting legislation is Delegate Ryan McEachin. He believes that legalizing sports betting in the state could generate upwards of $100 million in annual revenue. In a statement, McEachin said, “It is time for Virginians to have the opportunity to participate in this multi-billion dollar industry. This legislation will provide a new revenue stream for our Commonwealth while creating jobs and promoting tourism.”

It is not yet clear exactly how the Virginia sports betting legislation will work, but it is likely that the state will follow the lead of other states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. These states have authorized casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, and they have also set up regulatory frameworks to oversee the industry.

Some stakeholders in Virginia are opposed to legalized sports betting, arguing that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills. But Delegate McEachin counters that argument by noting that regulated sports betting would be tightly controlled and would only be available to those who are over 21 years of age.

At this point it is unclear whether or not the Virginia sports betting legislation will pass, but there appears to be growing momentum behind it. If it does become law, Virginians can look forward to being able to bet on their favorite teams both online and at physical locations throughout the state.

#  When Will Virginia Legally Allow Online Sports Betting? 

September 5, 2018. That's the earliest Virginia lawmakers can consider a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state, according to a report from The Virginian-Pilot.

The newspaper reports that Del. Christopher Stolle, R-Virginia Beach, will pre-file legislation next month that would allow online and in-person sports betting at casinos and racetracks in Virginia.

The Pilot notes that while the specifics of the legislation have yet to be released, it's likely that Stolle's bill would follow the lead of other states in allowing wagers on professional and college sports. 

Gambling is big business in Virginia, with nearly $1 billion wagered on horse races alone last year. But until now, sports betting has been illegal in the Commonwealth. 

That looks likely to change soon, as more states move to legalize sports betting in the aftermath of last month's U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down a federal ban on the activity. 

Del. Stolle told The Pilot that he believes Virginia should "move forward with this type of gaming," adding that it could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue for the state each year. 

Others are more cautious about legalizing sports betting, warning that it could lead to gambling addictions and other social problems. But with momentum building at the state level to legalize sports betting, it seems likely that Virginia will join the growing list of states where you can place a wager on your favorite team soon.

#  Proposed Legislation Could Legalize Sports Betting in Virginia 




RICHMOND, Va. – The possibility of legalizing sports betting in Virginia is picking up steam in the state’s legislature. 

A bill that would allow for sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the commonwealth was introduced last week by Delegate Ben Cline, a Republican from Augusta County. The measure has bipartisan support, with 22 co-sponsors – 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats. 

The proposed legislation comes as several states have moved to legalize sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the practice. 

Cline said his proposal would generate new revenue for the state and create jobs. “This is an issue that is important to many Virginians,” he said in a statement. “It is also an issue that can be addressed in a responsible way that will generate much-needed revenue for our Commonwealth and create jobs.” 

Virginia already has casinos and racetracks, but they are not allowed to offer sports betting. If Cline’s measure passes, it would be up to the individual facilities to decide whether they want to offer wagering on sporting events. 

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems, but supporters say those concerns can be addressed through regulation. 

The bill will be considered during this year’s legislative session, which begins next month.

#  Virginia Lawmakers Weighing Pros and Cons of Legalizing Sports Betting

As the US Supreme Court weighs the legality of sports betting, Virginia lawmakers are also considering the pros and cons of legalizing the activity.

On one hand, proponents of sports betting argue that it would generate tax revenue for the state, as well as create jobs. They also maintain that it would be a more regulated alternative to illegal gambling.

However, opponents of legalizing sports betting voice concerns about its potential for addiction and gambling-related crime. They also question how effective regulation would be in preventing underage gambling and other negative consequences.

So far, no decision has been made on whether or not to legalize sports betting in Virginia.
