Coping abilities bingo is a fun and adaptive way to help children and adults work on improving their coping skills. Playing this game can help to increase participants’ awareness of their own coping strategies, as well as the strategies of others. This can be a fun and engaging way for individuals to learn about healthy coping mechanisms, and have some fun in the process!

To play coping abilities bingo, each participant needs a sheet of paper with nine squares in a 3x3 grid. In each square, the player writes down one coping skill. The skills can be anything from “talking to a friend” to “taking a walk” to “eating healthy foods.” Once all of the squares are filled in, players take turns drawing cards from a deck and reading off the challenge or problem listed on the card. For example, if the card says “I had a fight with my best friend today,” the player must cross out the skill “talking to friends” on their sheet of paper. If they do not have that skill written down in one of their squares, they lose a turn. The first player to cross out all nine squares on their sheet of paper wins!
