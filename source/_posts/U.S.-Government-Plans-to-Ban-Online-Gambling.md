#  U.S. Government Plans to Ban Online Gambling

The United States government is planning to ban online gambling, according to a report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/politics/federal-government-gambling-ban.html">New York Times</a>. The ban, which would be enacted through an amendment to the Wire Act of 1961, would make it illegal for companies to offer online gambling services to US citizens.

The proposed amendment has been met with criticism from the gambling industry and some lawmakers. Opponents of the amendment argue that it will drive online gambling companies offshore and cost the US government millions in lost tax revenue. Supporters of the amendment maintain that it is necessary to protect citizens from fraud and addiction.

This is not the first time that the US government has attempted to ban online gambling. A similar proposal was made in 2006, but it was later repealed following strong opposition from the gambling industry and lawmakers. It is unclear whether this latest proposal will be successful.

#  Casinos Sue the US Government to Overturn Ban on Online Gambling

Casinos are suing the US Government to overturn a ban on online gambling, claiming it is unconstitutional.

The lawsuit, filed by the Casino Association of America (CAA), argues that the ban, introduced in 2006, infringes on the rights of casino operators and players.

"It's an unconstitutional prohibition that has nothing to do with protecting consumers," said CAA spokesman Geoff Freeman.

The suit, filed in a federal court in Washington D.C., calls for the ban to be overturned and for online gambling to be made legal.

It is not clear whether the courts will rule in favour of the casinos, but if they do, it could have a major impact on the gambling industry.

#  The Future of Online Gambling Looks Bright After New European Union Laws

Online gambling has been around since the early days of the internet, but itâ€™s only in recent years that it has really taken off. This is thanks in part to new European Union laws that have made it easier for companies to operate in multiple countries.

These laws have also made it easier for players to access online gambling sites from anywhere in Europe. This has helped to increase player numbers and create a more competitive market, which in turn has led to better bonuses and more games being offered.

The future looks bright for online gambling, with more countries set to legalize it in the coming years. This will help to create even more competition among operators, which will result in better deals for players.

#  Nevada Introduces Bill to Legalize Online Poker and Gambling

On Monday, February 12, the Nevada Senate introduced a bill that would legalize online poker and gambling in the state. The bill, known as SB227, was sponsored by Republican Joseph Hardy and would allow for licensed casinos in Nevada to offer betting services to residents and tourists over the internet.

Democratic Senator Ben Kieckhefer is one of the co-sponsors of the bill, and he believes that it has a good chance of passing. "There's been a lot of movement on this issue at both the state and federal level in recent years," Kieckhefer said in an interview with GamblingCompliance.com. "I think there's a general consensus among lawmakers that this is an area we should be exploring."

The introduction of SB227 comes at a time when online gambling is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. In 2017, the global online gambling market was worth an estimated $59.3 billion, and it is projected to grow to $81.7 billion by 2020. A number of states have already legalized some form of online gambling, including New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.

Nevada is hoping to become a leader in the industry by being one of the first states to legalize all forms of online gambling, including poker, slots, and blackjack. Under SB227, casinos would be allowed to partner with out-of-state companies to offer their services in Nevada. They would also be allowed to offer real-money wagering on horse races and other sporting events.

The bill has received bipartisan support so far, but there are some who oppose it. One argument against SB227 is that it could lead to increased addiction rates and social problems. However, supporters argue that these concerns can be mitigated by implementing strong regulations governing how the games are played.

It remains to be seen whether SB227 will pass in the Nevada Senate, but there is growing momentum behind online gambling nationwide. With more people choosing to gamble online every year, it seems likely that we will see more states legalize some form of internet gambling in the future.

#  Aereo Loses Supreme Court Battle, Could Impact American Online Gambling

In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court sided with broadcasters in their case against Aereo, the startup that allowed users to watch live or recorded TV over the internet for a monthly fee.

The ruling could have a major impact on American online gambling, as it strengthens the argument of broadcasters that the transmission of their content should be subject to licensing fees. This is important because some of the largest online gambling companies in the world, including Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, are based in the United States.

Aereo had argued that its service did not violate copyright law because each subscriber was given a unique antenna to access local broadcasts. The broadcasters countered that Aereo was simply rebroadcasting their content without permission or payment.

Justice Stephen Breyer, who authored the majority opinion, acknowledged that the technology used by Aereo is "legal enough," but said that it nonetheless violated copyright law because Aereo was built around "the unlawfulHughes/Aereo business model."

While there are still many questions about how this ruling will impact American online gambling, it is clear that broadcasters will be emboldened in their efforts to seek licensing fees from companies like Caesars and MGM. This could lead to increased costs for these companies, and ultimately mean fewer jobs and less revenue for the US economy.
