#  How to Play Shot Glass Roulette

Shot Glass Roulette is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is played with a set of shot glasses numbered 1-6, and a bottle of liquor. To play, each player takes turns spinning the bottle and drinking the shot glass that it points to. The first player to drink all six shots loses the game.

If you are playing Shot Glass Roulette by yourself, you can use a coin or a die to determine which glass to drink. Flip the coin or roll the die and drink the glass that corresponds to the number shown.

#  How to Turn Your Drinking Game into a Fun Competition 

Hey everyone, 

As the holidays quickly approach, many of us will be looking for ways to make gatherings with friends and family more enjoyable. One great way to do this is by turning your typical drinking game into a fun competition!

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1) Flip Cup - This is a classic drinking game that can easily be turned into a competition. Have each player race to drink their beer and then flip the cup upside down on the table so the opponent cannot drink. The first player to flip all of their cups wins!
2) Beer Pong - Another classic drinking game that can be turned into a competition is beer pong. Set up two teams of players and have them take turns throwing ping-pong balls into cups of beer. The team that drains all of the cups on their side first wins!
3) Quarters - This game can also be turned into a competition. Split players into two teams and have them stand at either end of a table. Place a quarter in the middle of the table and have players try to bounce it off the table and into their opponents hand. The first team to get 10 quarters wins!
4) Darts - This is another game that can easily be turned into a competition. Split players into two teams and set up some targets (a board, or simply some pieces of paper). Give each player 3 darts and allow them to throw at their opponents target. The team with the most points at the end wins!
5) Cards - Finally, cards can also be turned into a fun competition. Simply split players into two teams and deal out some cards. The team with the highest total number value on their cards wins!

#  Conquer Shot Glass Roulette and Have the Time of Your Life!

Shot Glass Roulette is the ultimate party game for any group of friends looking for a night of laughs and good times. With just a few simple supplies, you can have your own Shot Glass Roulette set up in minutes and be ready to start the party!

What You'll Need:

- A poster board or large piece of cardboard
- A sharpie or other type of marker
- 20-30 shot glasses
- A table or other flat surface
- Beverages of your choice (alcoholic or nonalcoholic)

How to Play:

To set up the game, draw a large roulette wheel on the poster board or cardboard. Use the sharpie to make dots on the wheel to indicate where each shot glass should be placed. You can make it as simple or complex as you want - just be sure that there is one space for each shot glass. If you want to make it even more challenging, you can also create different betting zones on the wheel.


Once the wheel is ready, it's time to play! Have all players gather around the table and give them each a stack of chips. One player will spin the wheel while everyone else bets on which slot their shot glass will end up in. The player who spun the wheel must then drink the contents of the shot glass in that zone. The game continues until one player has run out of chips or everyone is too drunk to continue!
