#  How Our Unique Roulette Wheel Works

Few casino games hold as much allure as Roulette - the glamour, the sophistication, and that ever-present whiff of risk. The spinning wheel and clatter of chips are instantly recognisable the world over. But what exactly is Roulette, and how does the game work?

Roulette is a classic casino game which can trace its origins back to 18th century France. The game is played on a circular table with a spinning wheel in the centre. There are 38 slots on the wheel, numbered 1-36 (plus 0 and 00), and players bet on where they think the ball will end up after the spin.

The aim of Roulette is to correctly predict where the ball will land on the wheel after it has been spun. You can bet on a individual number, or place a range of bets covering different combinations of numbers. The payout depends on the odds of your bet winning, with bigger payouts for rarer bets.

Roulette is a relatively easy game to learn but there are a few key things you need to know in order to play properly. Firstly, you need to understand the different types of bets available and how to calculate your winnings. Secondly, you need to be aware of the house edge - the percentage of each bet that casinos keep for themselves. This varies from game to game, but roulette typically has a house edge of around 2%.

Finally, you need to be aware that roulette is a game of chance and that there is no way to predict where the ball will land. Even if you have studied the odds carefully, there's no guarantee that you'll win any money from the game. With that in mind, it's important not to gamble more than you can afford to lose.

Now that you know how Roulette works, it's time to head to your nearest casino and give it a try!

#  Get a Spin on our Roulette Wheel and see for yourself how it works!

Roulette is a casino game that offers a high potential return to players, as well as plenty of excitement. The roulette wheel has 36 numbered slots – 18 red and 18 black – and a small green pocket numbered 0. Players can bet on a particular number, colour, odds or evens, or a combination of these.

The game is played by placing your chips on the grid layout printed on the felt tabletop. There are different coloured chips which represent different betting values. Once all the bets are placed, the croupier will spin the wheel in one direction and roll a ball around the circumference in the opposite direction. When the ball falls into a slot on the wheel, this determines the winning bet.

There are many strategies that can be used when playing roulette, but ultimately it is up to chance as to whether or not you will win. If you fancy giving roulette a go yourself, take advantage of our free spin on our online roulette wheel below!

#  Learn about the different types of roulette wheels and how they work

In roulette, there are a number of different wheel types that can be used. While the most common type is the European wheel, there are also American and French wheels. Each wheel has its own unique set of rules and odds.

The European wheel has 36 numbers, which are numbered 0-36. There is a single zero pocket, and all other pockets are numbered 1-36. This wheel offers better odds for players, as the house edge is only 2.7%.

The American wheel has 38 numbers, which are numbered 0-36 and 00-36. The double zero pocket increases the house edge to 5.26%, making it less favourable for players.

The French wheel has 37 numbers, which are numbered 0-36 and 1-36. This wheel offers better odds for players than the American wheel, with a house edge of 2.7%.
