- Two pair: This is when you have two cards of the same rank and two different cards of the same rank. For example, if you are holding two kings and two queens, then your two pair would be kings and queens. 

- Three of a kind: This is when you have three cards of the same rank. For example, if you are holding three eights, then your three of a kind would be eights. 

- One pair: This is when you have two cards of the same rank. For example, if you are holding two jacks, then your one pair would be jacks. 

- High card: This is when you don't have any pairs or better; in this case, the highest card in your hand will determine the winner.
